# life-data
iOS app that records personal habits and events that occur throughout the day.

When events take place (such as waking up, having coffee, getting to work, eating a meal, having a drink, going to bed, and more) one can manually record the events in time.  There is a page that shows the week's events in a graphical manner.  The end goal is to visualize your eating, drinking, and sleep habits, as well as emotional/mental state, so that one can take action and view measurable changes over time.
